I'd like you to initialize a vue3 typescript + tailwind project targeting modern browsers.
Were going to build a single page app that helps users translate text. Were going to use the openAI API and the user will provide an API key to use with it. It's going to be deployed on github pages. The user is going to provide a block of text in English. That should then be split into lines on each fullstop. Each sentance should be sent to chat GPT 5 for translation into french. Both the english and french sentance should then be sent to OpenAI text to speech. Then, the user interface should be two columns, the left one the original english, each sentance on a new line, then the corresponding french sentances should be on the right hand column. Clicking on a sentance should play the audio for that sentance while highlighting it. There should be a button at the top that plays the next sentance audio, which should go English -> French, next english -> next french. Whichever sentance is selected should be highlighted. If the next highlighted sentance is off the page it should scroll to it. Pressing space should also play the next sentance.
